# [DO NOT USE] `conpam` - [Experimental Project] PAM module / management application

***NEVER* USE THIS MODULE / APPLICATION UNDER ANY CIRCUMFERENCES!!** THIS PAM MODULE DOES NOT CARE ANYTHING ABOUT SECURITY!

**THIS MODULE / MANAGEMENT LACKS ANY SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS AND IS ABSOLUTELY UNSAFE TO USE. AS NOTED IN LICENSE.MD, I CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGED, OR OTHER LIABILITY!**

For example, this PAM module records the credential in plain JSON file. And the comparison is done with very simple `==`, so timing attack might be also an issue.
